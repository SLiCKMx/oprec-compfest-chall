# Very Exclusive

# Description
Not everyone likes exclusivity, but apparently this guy whose computer I hacked does! He seems to have encrypted all his files so only he exclusively can see them. I've brought to you what seems to be his encryption program and I can't seem to figure out how it works, and a sample encrypted file, can you help me out?
